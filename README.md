# dice_game

## Hello contributers!
I have made a dilce game in which on refreast the webpage dices show a random value and the the player who haves the high score at every re-fresh wins the game.

## Changes to be made 
<ol>
  <li>make this a responsive web</li>
  <li>rather then refreshing the web, have to make a button for every turn</li>
  <li>Instead of player first or second input from the user could be taken</li>
</ol>
